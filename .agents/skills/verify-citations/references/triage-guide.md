# Triage guide — what each flag means and how to fix it

Work through ERROR flags first, then WARN. For every fix: pull the canonical
record (see "Fetching canonical BibTeX" in
[verification-sources.md](verification-sources.md)), keep the original
citation key, show the user a before/after diff. Re-check fixed entries with
`--key {key}`, then run one full pass to confirm exit code 0.

## ERROR flags

### UNRESOLVED

Not found in Crossref, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, or arXiv. For `@article` /
`@inproceedings` / `@book` this is the strongest fabrication signal the
script can produce — indexed venues index their papers.

Triage, in order:
1. Check the title for typos or LaTeX damage (a mangled title can defeat
   search). If plausible, search manually with a corrected title.
2. Search a *distinctive phrase* from the title on DBLP and Crossref by hand.
3. Ask the user where the reference came from. If it arrived via an LLM
   (including this assistant) and cannot be located, treat it as fabricated.
4. Resolution is the user's call: supply the real reference, vouch for an
   unindexed source (then keep with a `note = {...}` pointing at it), or
   remove the entry *and* its `\cite` commands and fix surrounding prose.

Never swap in a different real paper that "sounds right" — that converts a
visible fabrication into an invisible misattribution, which is worse.

### DOI_NOT_FOUND / ARXIV_NOT_FOUND

The identifier resolves nowhere (Crossref + DataCite for DOIs; arXiv for
eprint IDs). Two cases:

- Accompanied by `POSSIBLE_ID_TYPO` — the title exists; the script prints
  the canonical URL/DOI. Replace the bad identifier with the canonical one.
- Alone — both the identifier and the title fail: treat as
  [UNRESOLVED](#unresolved). Fabricated references often pair a real-looking
  title with an invented DOI; the DOI failing is the tell.

### TITLE_MISMATCH

The DOI/ID resolves to a *different paper* (similarity < 0.60). This is
usually a copy-paste error (DOI of the paper above/below in some listing) or
a hallucinated DOI attached to a real title. Decide which side is right:
search the .bib title (is there a paper with this title and a different
DOI?), and resolve the DOI in a browser (what paper is it really?). Fix
whichever side the user actually meant to cite.

### AUTHOR_MISMATCH

First author's family name differs between .bib and the canonical record.
After ruling out the false positives below, this means the entry attributes
the paper to the wrong people — a credibility-killer in front of a reviewer
who knows the area. Replace the author list from the canonical record.

### YEAR_MISMATCH

More than ±1 year apart. Common honest causes: citing the arXiv year for the
published version (or vice versa), or confusing a journal's volume year with
publication year. Set the year to match the version actually cited — if
`booktitle`/`journal` names the venue, use the venue's year.

### RETRACTED

A retraction notice exists (the script prints the notice DOI), or the
publisher renamed the record "RETRACTED ARTICLE: ...". Required handling:

1. Tell the user verbatim, with the notice DOI. Do not soften it.
2. Default action: remove the citation and adjust any claim that leaned on
   it (the claim may now be unsupported — say so).
3. If the user must cite it (history-of-science, studying the retraction
   itself), keep it but mark it: `note = {Retracted; see
   doi:10.xxxx/notice}` and make sure the prose acknowledges the retraction.
4. `EXPRESSION_OF_CONCERN` (WARN) gets the same conversation at lower
   urgency: flag it, let the user decide, suggest a sturdier alternative if
   one exists.

### Duplicates

- **DUPLICATE_KEY** — BibTeX silently drops one definition; which one wins
  depends on the tool. Rename one key and update its `\cite` commands.
- **DUPLICATE_DOI / DUPLICATE_TITLE** — same paper under two keys (classic
  cause: one teammate added the arXiv version, another the published one).
  Keep the published version, delete the other entry, and repoint all
  `\cite` commands to the surviving key (`grep -rn '\\cite[a-z]*{.*oldkey'
  *.tex` to find them).

### Malformed identifiers

- **MALFORMED_DOI** — DOIs match `10.NNNN/suffix`. Strip URL prefixes
  (`https://doi.org/`), `doi:` labels, and trailing punctuation; if what
  remains still is not a DOI, treat as DOI_NOT_FOUND.
- **MALFORMED_ARXIV_ID** — valid shapes are `2104.12345` (optionally `v2`)
  or old-style `cs.DB/0123456`. Fix the `eprint` field; the
  `archivePrefix = {arXiv}` field should accompany it.

## WARN flags

| Flag | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| POSSIBLE_ID_TYPO | Bad identifier, but the title exists; canonical DOI printed | Replace identifier from canonical record |
| MISSING_DOI | Entry resolved via search; a DOI exists | Add the printed `doi = {...}` — makes future verification unambiguous |
| TITLE_PARTIAL_MATCH | Similarity 0.60–0.85 | Usually subtitle dropped, "RETRACTED" prefix, or LaTeX braces; align with canonical title |
| AUTHOR_LIST_DIFFERS | First author matches; list incomplete or extra names | Complete the list from the canonical record, or end with `and others` deliberately |
| VENUE_MISMATCH | Venue strings disagree | Check the [venue-alias problem](verification-sources.md#the-venue-alias-problem) before changing anything — most hits are aliases |
| NOT_IN_INDEXES | `@techreport`/`@phdthesis` etc. not indexed | Normal for these types; verify by hand against the institution's page, add `url = {...}` |
| MISSING_FIELDS | Required fields for the entry type absent | Fill from canonical record; venues' bib styles error or render badly without them |
| IMPLAUSIBLE_YEAR | Not a 4-digit year in 1900..next year | Fix the typo |
| EXPRESSION_OF_CONCERN | Publisher signaled doubts | See [RETRACTED](#retracted), point 4 |
| ENTRY_TYPE_MISMATCH | BibTeX type contradicts the resolved record (journal article or monograph typed `@inproceedings`, a `booktitle` naming a journal/publisher, or `@inproceedings` carrying `journal=`) | See [ENTRY_TYPE_MISMATCH](#entry_type_mismatch) — set the type from the canonical record's `type` |
| CANONICAL_INSTANCE | Title resolves, but a different artifact is what the field cites | See [CANONICAL_INSTANCE](#canonical_instance) — pick the instance your readers cite |
| LOW_RELEVANCE | Resolves, but low topical fit to the paper | See [references/relevance-gate.md](relevance-gate.md) — confirm load-bearing, never auto-remove |

### ENTRY_TYPE_MISMATCH

The title matched (recall is fine), but the BibTeX **entry type** contradicts
what the resolved record actually is. The recurring failure this catches: a
journal article or a monograph typed `@inproceedings` (often with
`booktitle = {Springer}`, `booktitle = {MIT Press}`, or a journal name as the
booktitle), or a conference paper carrying a `journal=` field. Such an entry
resolves and its title checks out, yet it renders wrong and would fail a strict
verification pass — the metadata was never reconciled to the canonical record.

How the script decides (generic — keyed on the resolved record, never on a named
venue or paper):

1. It maps the resolved record's Crossref `type` (e.g. `journal-article`,
   `monograph`, `proceedings-article`) to the BibTeX type(s) that record should
   carry. When Crossref has no `type`, it falls back to a coarse venue class
   (journal / conference / book / standard-report / preprint).
2. It flags the declared type when it is not among the expected set.
3. Independently, it lints container fields: an `@inproceedings`/`@incollection`
   whose `booktitle` names a journal ("Transactions", "Letters", "…Analysis"),
   or a bare publisher ("Springer", "MIT Press"), or that carries a `journal=`
   field at all.

This is **WARN-only and advisory** — the script never rewrites the type. Loose
catch-all types (`@misc`, `@online`, `@software`, `@unpublished`,
`@techreport`) are skipped, so a deliberately-loose entry is never flagged, and
a correct `@article`/`@inproceedings` produces no flag.

Triage:
1. Fetch the canonical BibTeX (see "Fetching canonical BibTeX" in
   [verification-sources.md](verification-sources.md)) — the DBLP `.bib`
   endpoint or doi.org content negotiation emits the correct `@type` and the
   right container field (`journal=`/`booktitle=`/`publisher=`).
2. Replace the entry body, keep the original citation key, show the diff. Use
   the **original** DOI, not a reprint/anthology DOI, when both exist.
3. Re-check with `--key {key}` and confirm the flag clears.

Never set the type by guessing — pull it from the record, the same rule as every
other fix in this gate.

### CANONICAL_INSTANCE

Resolution proved the identifier points at a real record — but the *named
work* exists as more than one real artifact, and the script found that a
**different** instance is the one the field predominantly cites (it carries
materially more citations). Common shapes, all of them generic patterns the
script detects from venue strings and citation counts, never a hardcoded list:

- the original **conference/journal paper** vs a later **RFC, standard,
  tech-report, or working draft** that re-states the same result;
- a **preprint** vs the **published** version (when the published one is what
  everyone cites);
- a paper vs a **book chapter / extended journal version** of it.

Why it matters: citing the wrong artifact reads as not knowing the literature,
and reviewers who know the area notice. The classic tell is an entry that
resolves cleanly to a standards-body or report DOI while the community's
citation graph points at the venue paper.

Triage:
1. Read the alternatives the script printed (each with a citation count and a
   resolvable URL — all are real records it retrieved, none invented).
2. Decide which artifact you *mean* to cite. Usually it is the most-cited
   venue paper; sometimes the standard/report is correct (you are citing the
   protocol, not the analysis) — that is your call.
3. If you switch, fetch the chosen artifact's canonical BibTeX (see "Fetching
   canonical BibTeX" in [verification-sources.md](verification-sources.md)),
   keep the citation key, show the diff.
4. If the current instance is the right one, keep it — the flag is advisory.

Never auto-swap. The script surfaces; you and the user choose.

## INFO flags

- **UNVERIFIABLE_TYPE** — websites/software (`@misc` with only a URL).
  Scholarly indexes cannot confirm these; open the URL, confirm it is live
  and says what the entry claims, prefer adding `urldate = {YYYY-MM-DD}`.
- **RESOLVED_VIA_SEARCH** — no identifier in the entry; matched by title.
  Trust, but add the suggested DOI (see MISSING_DOI).
- **HAS_CORRECTION** — an erratum exists. Usually fine to cite the original;
  mention the erratum to the user if the cited claim might be the corrected
  part.
- **RELEVANCE_OK** — the relevance gate scored this entry as a good topical
  fit. Informational; no action.
- **CHECK_SKIPPED** — every index that could resolve this entry was
  unreachable this run. The entry is **not** verified (and **not** branded
  UNRESOLVED — that would falsely imply fabrication). The run is PARTIAL-PASS;
  re-run the entry with `--key` once connectivity returns.

## The PARTIAL-PASS verdict

The script prints one overall verdict: **PASS**, **PARTIAL-PASS**, or
**FAIL**.

- **PASS** — all selected entries were checked online with no errors.
- **FAIL** — at least one entry has an ERROR flag. Fix before submission.
- **PARTIAL-PASS** — no errors, but at least one authoritative index was
  unreachable, so some checks did not run. The script lists exactly which
  checks were skipped (e.g. "DOI resolution, metadata & retraction checks
  (Crossref)") and how many entries fell back to `CHECK_SKIPPED`.

A PARTIAL-PASS is **not** a clean bill of health — it means "checked what I
could reach." Report it as PARTIAL-PASS verbatim, never as "passed". Re-run
the skipped checks once connectivity returns (or with `--refresh`) before
declaring the bibliography verified. In `--strict` (CI gate) mode a
PARTIAL-PASS exits nonzero, because a gate that could not run every check has
not passed.

## Known false positives

- **Online-first vs print year**: Crossref `issued` can be one year earlier
  than the print year a .bib cites. The script tolerates ±1; do not "fix"
  these without checking.
- **arXiv vs published version**: preprint year < venue year. If the entry
  has a real `booktitle`/`journal`, the venue record is authoritative — the
  script already prefers DBLP/Crossref in that case.
- **Venue aliasing**: see
  [verification-sources.md](verification-sources.md#the-venue-alias-problem).
- **Author-list truncation**: `and others` is legitimate BibTeX; the script
  only subset-checks then. `et al.` inside the author field is not — flagged
  under MISSING_FIELDS.
- **Diacritics and LaTeX accents**: `G{\"o}del` vs `Gödel` compare equal
  after normalization; if an AUTHOR flag involves accents, suspect a deeper
  mismatch, not the accent.
- **Mononyms and consortia** ("DeepMind Team", "The HDF Group"): family-name
  heuristics are unreliable — verify by eye before editing.
- **Very short titles** ("Attention", "GPT-4"): fuzzy matching is weak below
  ~15 characters; confirm short-title matches manually.

## The fix workflow, end to end

```bash
# 1. Full check, machine-readable report for the calling skill
python3 scripts/check_bibtex.py refs.bib --json /tmp/citecheck.json

# 2. For each broken entry: fetch the canonical BibTeX
curl -sL -H "Accept: application/x-bibtex" "https://doi.org/10.1145/1327452.1327492"
curl -s "https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cacm/DeanG08.bib"

# 3. Replace the entry body, KEEP the original citation key, show the diff

# 4. Re-verify just the fixed entries
python3 scripts/check_bibtex.py refs.bib --key dean2008mapreduce --refresh

# 5. Final gate: full pass, strict mode for submission-critical runs.
#    --strict exits nonzero on warnings AND on PARTIAL-PASS, so this only
#    prints "GATE PASSED" on a true PASS — never on an unreachable-index run.
python3 scripts/check_bibtex.py refs.bib --strict && echo "GATE PASSED"

# Optional: relevance-gate independently-added references against the thesis.
